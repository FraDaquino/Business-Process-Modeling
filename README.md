# Business-Process-Modeling
BPM Project at @UniPi a.y. 2023/24

This repository contains the files and report for the development of a business process modeling project.

Specifically, the project aims to analyze processes related to a scenario involving a painting school managing student requests.
The work showcases process diagrams designed using Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Following this, the analysis of the processes is deepened by transforming the BPMN diagrams into Petri Nets for further exploration and verification of the properties of the obtained networks.

The files in the repository are organized as follows:
- The BPMN file represents the entire process, including the flows between the three actors involved.
- The PNML files represent the Petri Net notation, with each actor having an individual PNML file for their specific process.
- The report (.PDF) provides a detailed explanation of each step taken and the assumptions made throughout the project.
